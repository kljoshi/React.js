- Need to install Node.js
- Using "cmd" cd into the folder where you would like to setup react 
- react can be setup in a particular folder without needing to install it into your device
- to do this simple type "npx create-react-app <filepath>"
- you also need to use "npm start" command inside the folder where react was extracted to open terminal 
- where you can see functionality of your code 


--- notes for myself 
how the information is going through react 
- index.html -> index.js -> App.js
